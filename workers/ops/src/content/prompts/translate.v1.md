Translate this manufacturing blog article into ${langName}.${languageSpecificNote}

RULES:
- Keep "${BRAND_NAME}" unchanged
- Preserve ALL HTML tags and attributes exactly (including href, class, etc.)
- IMPORTANT: Translate the TEXT inside <a> tags (anchor text), but keep the href URLs unchanged
- Example: <a href="/en/services">our services</a> becomes <a href="/en/services">[translated text]</a>
- Do NOT translate URLs in href attributes - keep them exactly as they are
- Remove any links to "/dashboard" or "/en/dashboard" - these are internal admin links and should not appear
- Translate all visible text content including link text
- CRITICAL TABLE PRESERVATION: 
  * Table placeholders like <!--TABLE_0--> are HTML comments that MUST remain EXACTLY as written
  * Do NOT modify, translate, remove, or change these HTML comment placeholders in any way
  * These placeholders will be replaced with actual tables after translation
